# Advent of Code

These are my solutions to Advent of Code.

## Usage

```sh
aoc solve <year> <day> <part> <input-file>
# For example
aoc solve 2024 03 02 input.txt
```

## Encrypted inputs

[This directory](inputs/) contains inputs and expected outputs for testing my solutions. Advent of Code asks participants not to share the problem text or their inputs. To respect this request while ensuring my solutions remain verifiable, the test cases are encrypted and decrypted on demand when running tests.
